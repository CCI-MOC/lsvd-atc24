\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Environment}

All experiments were run on a 6-machine cluster, 4 of which hosted Ceph OSDs, 1
hosted the gateway, and another hosted the client. All hosts ran unmodified
Ubuntu 22.04. The OSDs ran Ceph 17.2.6, with a pool of 16 Samsung P1635a 1.6TB
SSDs and another pool of 48 Seagate Constellation.2 ST91000640SS 1TB HDDs.

All hosts had dual-socket Intel Xeon E5-2660 v2 CPUs and 128 GiB of DDR3-1600
RAM.

Where mentioned, experimental VMs were plain QEMU VMs running unmodified
Ubuntu 22.04 server images. The images were obtained by running the unattended
install on the Ubuntu server image distribution with most options unchanged.
