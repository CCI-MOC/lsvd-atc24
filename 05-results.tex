\section{Results} \label{sec:results}

- microbenchmarks: fio randread/write, vary bs, qd,
- filebench

- compare lsvd/rbd
- theoretical upper limit with local nvme

- latency histograms? bimodal of hit/miss should show up somewhere
- vm boot results
- image optimization

Notes on figures themselves:

- Separate by workload instead of config
- ex one fileserver graph with all the configs instead of multiple with fileserver


-- more results to be added--
