	Storage systems consist of two independent but often tightly coupled
	dimensions: capacity and performance (i.e. IOPS). Tying both together is
	unavoidable when deploying hardware in a datacenter, but this need not be
	the case in software when disaggregating storage. Existing solutions to
	disaggregated block storage, however, have yet to fully explore the
	potential of decoupling these two dimensions; they either place processing
	on the client, tying performance to fixed local hardware, or on the backend,
	tying performance to decisions made during capacity provisioning.

	We propose a new approach, moving processing to an intermediate gateway
	layer on neither the client nor backend. We show that this disaggregates
	performance from capacity as gateway servers can be independently scaled
	from capacity and client servers. Our prototype demonstrates near-SSD
	performance for common workloads, while also decreasing backend utilisation
	compared to existing approaches.
