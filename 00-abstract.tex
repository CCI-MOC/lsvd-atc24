	Traditional open solutions to disaggregated storage are reliant on backend
	bandwidth and storage medium performance. Writes are especially costly
	due to requirements around consistency and replication.

	We propose a log-structured virtual disk on a central storage gateway,
	disaggregating storage performance from backend performance. Our prototype
	demonstrates dramatic improvements in both write and read performance for
	common workloads, while also decreasing backend utilisation.
