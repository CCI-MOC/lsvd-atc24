\section{Background and Motivation}

Explain the architecture of:

- How much of LSVD do we explain here?

\subsection{Semantics}

- Don't lose data - remote journal in a different failure domain

- Sources of overhead: 
    - IO amplification per write request
    - Replication consistency invariants to maintain
    - Data consistency between writes -- maintain ordering

- Solved with batched writes (with write journal)
    - Doesn't this just move the problem to our gateway instead?

- Backend representation is always self-consistent - we never present a non-consistent
  view of the disk at any point in time

\subsection{Ceph RADOS Block Device}

- Fairly simple implementation

- Image is divided up into xMB chunks, each of them mapped to a RADOS object

- Writes just write to that object, reads read from the object

- Clones and snapshots are COW for that object

- Since pools are triple-replicated, incredible amonuts of amplification

- Consistency for the three copies, cost to maintain consistency is high

\subsection{Others}

- What we know about other proprietary elastic block stores

- Bring up OpenStack Cinder? Not a storage system, just an API on top of others
